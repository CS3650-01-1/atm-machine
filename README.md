# ATM Machine

ATM Machine is a machine that users can use to access their accounts (savings/checking) and accomplish various tasks. Users can withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds.

## Requirements

The project uses **SQLite** as its DBMS and **peewee** as an ORM. There is no need to download SQLite because it comes bundled with Python 3. On the other hand, peewee and future potential packages can be installed with
```pip install -r reqs.txt```
